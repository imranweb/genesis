## Create shared utilities and components

- Create react component in shared library `nx generate @nrwl/react:component --name=<component name> --project=ui-kit`

- To create story file for components `nx generate @nrwl/react:stories --project=ui-kit`

## Nx Cloud

### Computation Memoization in the Cloud

Nx Cloud pairs with Nx in order to enable you to build and test code more rapidly, by up to 10 times. Even teams that are new to Nx can connect to Nx Cloud and start saving time instantly.

Teams using Nx gain the advantage of building full-stack applications with their preferred framework alongside Nxâ€™s advanced code generation and project dependency graph, plus a unified experience for both frontend and backend developers.
